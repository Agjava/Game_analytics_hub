## üí° Design Philosophy
Based on Human-Computer Interaction research and user survey insights, this project addresses the perspective change in user preferences. When surveyed about website design priorities, 57% of users preferred simplicity while 43% wanted feature-rich interfaces.

Solution: A hybrid approach that satisfies both user groups:

1. Simple, clean homepage for users who value minimalism

2. Feature-rich dedicated pages for users who want advanced functionality

3. Progressive disclosure - users can choose their level of engagement

This design philosophy demonstrates how understanding user perspectives can drive thoughtful interface decisions, creating an inclusive experience that doesn't force users to choose between simplicity and functionality.

## Deployment

### Jira https://ufl-team-agrol4kk.atlassian.net/jira/polaris/projects/GAH/ideas/view/7181920

### Backend Deployment (Render)

1. Create a new Web Service on Render
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set the build command to `cd backend && npm install`
4. Set the start command to `cd backend && npm start`
5. Add all environment variables from your backend `.env` file
6. Deploy the service

### Frontend Deployment (Netlify)

1. Create a new site on Netlify
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set the build command to `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`
4. Set the publish directory to `frontend/build`
5. Add the `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable pointing to your deployed backend
6. Deploy the site

## GitHub Actions CI/CD

The repository includes GitHub Actions workflows for both backend and frontend:

- `.github/workflows/backend.yml`: Tests and deploys the backend to Render
- `.github/workflows/frontend.yml`: Builds and deploys the frontend to Netlify

To use these workflows, you need to add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

- `RENDER_SERVICE_ID`: Your Render service ID
- `RENDER_API_KEY`: Your Render API key
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Netlify authentication token
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`: Your Netlify site ID
- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: URL of your deployed backend API

## Kaggle API Integration

To use the Kaggle API integration:

1. Create a Kaggle account at https://www.kaggle.com/
2. Generate API credentials in your account settings
3. Add your Kaggle username and key to the backend `.env` file
4. Use the admin interface to import gaming datasets

## OAuth Setup

### Google OAuth

1. Create a project in the Google Developer Console
2. Configure the OAuth consent screen
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
4. Add authorized redirect URIs (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/google/callback` for development)
5. Add your client ID and secret to the backend `.env` file

### GitHub OAuth

1. Create a new OAuth application in GitHub Developer Settings
2. Set the homepage URL to your frontend URL
3. Set the callback URL to your backend auth callback (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api/auth/github/callback` for development)
4. Add your client ID and secret to the backend `.env` file
